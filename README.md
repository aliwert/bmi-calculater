# BMI Calculator

This project showcases an interactive BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate their BMI based on their age, gender, height, and weight.

## Overview

The BMI calculator provides a simple yet effective way for users to assess their body mass index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight. By inputting their age, selecting their gender, and providing their height and weight, users can quickly determine their BMI. The calculator then categorizes the result into different health categories such as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obese, and extremely obese.

## Usage

To use this BMI calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Input your age, select your gender, and enter your height and weight.
3. Click the "Submit" button to calculate your BMI.
4. View your BMI result and see which health category you fall into.

## Customization

You can customize the BMI calculator by adjusting the styling in the `style.css` file and modifying the JavaScript code in the `app.js` file. Additionally, you can enhance the calculator by adding more features, such as saving previous calculations or providing additional health-related information.
